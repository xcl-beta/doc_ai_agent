## Key Takeaways

⎯ ⎯ The financial turmoil of 2008 specifically equity market volatility is having a

dramatic effect on variable annuity (VA) writers. Persistent adverse market conditions

will pressure life insurers’ earnings and risk-based capital levels for the balance of 2008

and into 2009. The industry’s ability to manage this growing risk exposure represents

one of the most significant risk management challenges confronting U.S. life insurers.

• Based on Fitch’s capital model, capital (and reserves) needed to support the VA

business of U.S. life insurers has increased by up to $15 billion during 2008 year-to-

date due to the dramatic decline in the equity markets, which has caused VA

guarantees to become increasingly “in-the-money.” Fitch’s estimate assumes that

“in-the-moneyness” has increased by approximately 10% in 2008 year-to-date.

• VA profitability in 2008 has been negatively impacted by reduced fee revenue due

to lower net asset values, increased hedging costs, and reserving associated with

product guarantees. GAAP profitability will also be negatively impacted in the

second half of 2008 by deferred acquisition cost (DAC) unlocking.

• Fitch is concerned that insurers are overly optimistic about the effectiveness of

their hedging programs, which have not been tested under prolonged adverse

market conditions. Given record highs in implied volatilities, the cost of purchasing

derivative contracts to support hedging programs will rise and adversely affect net

income. In addition, the performance of these hedge programs will suffer as pricing

assumptions did not forecast this elevated volatility level.

• The economy may cause policyholders to utilize product features that are outside the

boundaries of actuarial formulas. As policyholders exercise options, such as withdrawal or

income benefits, net asset values will further decrease and add more pressure to the

income statement. In addition, these in-the-money options will become realized rather

than be “paper gains” that can evaporate as the market returns to normality.

• Fitch expects a number of insurers to “rationalize” their participation in the VA

business due to the heightened level of capital and earnings volatility experienced

in 2008. For some larger players that have had brisk sales over the past two to three

years, the prospect of depressed net income coupled with increase capital

requirements will be the tipping point to refocus energies on other product lines.

For the smaller players (those outside the top 10), the cost burden due to their lack

of size efficiency will force them to sell or run-off their VA business.

• Although this report focuses on variable annuities, many of these issues are

applicable to other equity-based products with embedded guarantees such as

variable life, variable universal life and equity-indexed annuities.

## Setting the Table ⎯ Déjà Vu All Over Again?

2000−2002 ⎯ In many ways, what we are seeing in 2008 is reminiscent of the period a

very strong sales pattern followed by a severe market correction. Combining strong

sales in a rising market is an evil witch’s brew as insurers find themselves exposed to

potentially significant losses. Obviously, several VA writers did not make it through the

last correction and we anticipate a similar pattern with today’s writers.

To compare the current market with the prior correction, consider:

• From Sept. 1, 2000 to Oct. 9, 2002, the S&P 500 Index lost nearly 50% of its value.

The annual return for 2000, 2001 and 2002 was -10%, -13% and -23%, respectively.

This was the first time since the end of the Great Depression that there were three

consecutive years of negative returns.

• Through Oct. 13, 2008, the S&P 500 had a 35% decline since the start of the year. The

greatest single calendar year decline was 47% in 1931. Since the end of World War II,

the largest 12-month decline was 41% from September 1973 to September 1974. As a

point of reference, the last time the index value was at this level of 953 was over five

⎯ years ago May 30, 2003.

• The following chart of the S&P 500 illustrates the “twin peaks” over the last 15 years

and the annual returns since 1930.

assets of U.S. variable annuities was $1.41 trillion at June 30, 2008. Fueled by market

appreciation, this is a 175% increase since Dec. 31, 2002, when the net asset value was

Due to growth in VA assets, the balance sheet of the U.S. life insurance industry is

becoming increasingly leveraged to the equity markets. At year-end 2007, the ratio of

industry VA assets to total industry reserves (VA ratio) increased to 31.8% versus 30.6%

at year-end 2006 and 25.0% at year-end 2002.

## VA Capital Requirements ⎯ Volatile and Increasing

Life insurers that sell VAs with guaranteed death and living benefits are essentially

writing/selling an embedded equity put option. While the growth rates look similar, the

risk profile of the products sold over the two periods is very different due to the

aggressive product guarantees introduced in recent years (see Appendix for description

of various VA product features). Under most scenarios, the VA business generates

favorable returns. However, in certain highly unlikely but still plausible market

scenarios (i.e., tail events), the investment portfolio will underperform the guarantees,

which causes insurers to potentially suffer significant losses. It is this exposure to tail

risk that drives capital (and reserve) requirements for the VA business.

Capital requirements increase as the in-the-moneyness (policyholder guarantees divided

by net asset values) increases. Fitch estimates that capital needed to support the VA

business has increased in 2008 year-to-date by up to $15 billion, which equates to

approximately 1% of net asset value. This estimate assumes that in-the-moneyness has

increased by approximately 10% in 2008 year-to-date.

large decline) for a ‘AA’ stress level is 1.8% of net asset value. Assuming a net

asset value of $1.41 trillion implies a $25.4 billion target capital.

2) Assuming the embedded guarantees are 5% higher than those reported at Dec. 31,

2007, the target capital increases 20% to 2.2%. The target capital amount is

$31.0 billion or $5.6 billion higher than year end.

Although these target capital percentages seem modest, it is our opinion that many

insurers are generating much lower capital requirements based on their own

internal models, and thus allocate much lower capital to their VA business.

The following charts show how variable annuities have significant “tail risk,” which

is illustrated in the “hockey stick” shape of the risk distribution. In other words,

more than 90% of the scenarios provide capital generation (i.e., earnings) while 1%

of the scenarios generate large losses and capital needs.

##### Current Regulatory Reserving and Capital Requirements Modest

Reserving and capital requirements are shifting to internal stochastic models created by

insurers rather than factors determined by regulators. Current minimum regulatory

capital requirements (i.e., “C3 Phase II”) are set at CTE90 (conditional tail expectation)

level less statutory reserves. Fitch believes CTE90 corresponds to a ‘BBB+’ level of

capitalization. In comparison, ‘AA’ level is more commensurate to CTE98.

Although Fitch recognizes the benefits of internal stochastic models (increased data

granularity, differing product features and understanding tail events), we caution

industry observers that each model is unique with material differences in parameters

and assumptions based on human judgment.

## Significant Earnings Challenges Over Near Term

##### 1. Expect Depressed Fee Revenues

Obviously, fee income will be down for those carriers that assess product fees on net

asset values. Mathematically, a 35% decrease implies the market needs to increase

54% to return to its original value [(1-35%)*(1+54%) = 100%]. In other words, the equity

markets need to average 9% over the next five years to return to year-end 2007 levels.

Often, mutual funds pay a portion of their investment management fees to VA

writers in order to be included in the product prospectus. These arrangements are

⎯ typically short term one to three years. We may see these mutual funds re-

negotiate fee arrangements in order to meet their own expenses.

##### 2. Hedge Programs Will Cost More

Hedge programs have been implemented at many of the largest VA writers. These

programs were designed either to lessen earnings volatility or protect capital. Fitch

anticipates the cost of running these hedge programs will significantly increase given

the spike in option volatility. Indeed, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility

Index (VIX), which is a measure of implied volatility of S&P 500 index options, is trading

above 75 in the first weeks of October compared with a historical average of 20.

##### 3. Reserving for Embedded Guarantees Increasing

Reserves, like capital, are sensitive to changes in the in-the-moneyness of the

embedded guarantees in the VA product. While VA writers do actively hedge this

risk exposure, Fitch expects increased hedge “breakage” over the near term due to

increased market volatility and deviation in policyholder behavior assumptions.

## Policyholder Behavior Could Cause Additional Issues

A key assumption is guesstimating how policyholders will utilize or exercise these product

guarantees. Unlike, mortality studies, there is not a rich and deep statistical base to draw

upon for policyholder behavior. In addition, the current economy will force many people

to tap into retirement products not contemplated by these actuarial formulas. It is easy

to imagine that many policyholders in today’s economic environment will:

• Elect their guaranteed income benefit if they are forced into early retirement, or;

• Increase their guaranteed withdrawal benefits to help defray day-to-day living costs.

There is some evidence that policyholders monitor their VA policy closely. Although

total sales have been impressive, there is a significant gap with respect to net sales,

which reflects IRS Section 1035 exchanges (no benefit to the industry) and withdrawals

or surrenders (outflows to the industry).

### Insurance

<!-- Table 1: pos=(0.00,82.26,612.00,99.18) -->
Fitch considers this policyholder behavior to be the wild card in any analysis and the

embedded optionality exposes insurers to significant tail risk. This behavior will become

increasingly efficient in the future due to:

• Insurers offering “bonus” annuities to attract new policyholders.

• Life settlement companies searching for other policies to purchase, thus creating a

secondary market for in-the-money guarantees.

• Policyholders (or their financial advisors) will become more financially astute and

utilize free transfers between sub-accounts or free withdrawals to the detriment of

the insurer.

The lack of utilization data through several economic cycles make it nearly impossible

to create a perfect formula. Fitch’s model uses a rather simple dynamic function

between in-the-moneyness and utilization (a more complicated function could include

policyholder age, contract age, surrender charges). When we alter this function, we

60−90 estimate that it could add basis points to the target capital levels (using “Insurer

billion−$15 A” as the example), which could add $10 billion of additional capital needs.

## Appendix

##### Variable Annuity Product Guarantees

The product’s success can be directly attributed to an aging population looking for

retirement protection, the ability to participate in the equity market performance with

guarantees that provide downside protection and attractive product features that can

be utilized while the policyholder is living.

The key financial risks associated with VAs are tied to the product’s guarantees. There

are four basic guarantee features that are actively sold in the market today.

(GMDB): A GMDB rider allows for the 1. Guaranteed minimum death benefit

policyholder’s beneficiary to receive the greater of current account value or a

guaranteed amount upon the death of the policyholder. The “standard”

guaranteed amount (also known as return of premium). Variations allows for some

type of enhanced guaranteed amount based on a step-up rate or maximum

account value. The risk for insurers is the probability of death while the

guaranteed benefit exceeds the current account value (or the net amount at risk).

(GMIB): A GMIB rider allows for the 2. Guaranteed minimum income benefit

policyholder to elect to receive a guaranteed income stream for life after a pre-

determined accumulation period (e.g., 10 years). The insurer guarantees a

minimum interest rate during the accumulation period. The income benefit

requires the policyholder to “annuitize” the contract. The risk for insurers is that

the account value could be exhausted before the end of the annuitization period.

(GMWB): GMWB riders are the most 3. Guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit

popular guarantee in the market at this time. A GMWB rider allows for the

policyholder to receive a guaranteed minimum stream of withdrawals for either a

set period or for the lifetime of the policyholder. The policyholder may elect to

begin taking withdrawals upon purchase of the VA or at some point in the future.

A number of insurers offer a deferred bonus feature that pays the policyholder a

bonus, which can range from 6% to 7%, or more, if the policyholder delays taking

withdrawal benefits for a period of time. The policyholder is not required to

“annuitize” the contract in order to begin receiving withdrawal benefits. The risk

for insurers is that the account value is exhausted before all of the guaranteed

withdrawal benefits are paid.

(GMAB): A GMAB rider allows the 4. Guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit

policyholder to receive the greater of current account value or a guaranteed

amount at the end of the accumulation period. There are multiple variations to

the guaranteed amount, but is most typically based on a step-up rate or

maximum account value. The risk for insurers is that the guaranteed benefit

exceeds the current account value at the end of the accumulation period.

##### VA Risk Management

Risk management has become an area of increasing focus in recent years due to growth

in the VA business and the increasingly complex nature of the guarantees. Insurers

selling variable annuities attempt to mitigate risk (and reduce capital requirements)

using three basic approaches:

• Product design

• Reinsurance

• Hedging

### Insurance

<!-- Table 1: pos=(0.00,82.26,612.00,99.18) -->
#### Product Design

Product design is the first line of defense in VA risk management. The primary product

features used to mitigate VA risk include fee structure, surrender charges and asset

allocation restrictions. Over the past couple of years, the industry has increasingly

moved to a fee structure that is tied to the greater of current account value and

annuity deposits, which protects the fee income stream in down equity markets.

Prism, Fitch’s insurance capital model, captures product design information for an

insurer’s book of VA business and considers that information in the determination of the

insurer’s capital charges.

#### Reinsurance

The market for reinsurance of VA risk has been relatively limited over the past decade.

More recently, Fitch has seen a modest increase in reinsurance activity by a limited

⎯ number of reinsurers. Reinsurance arrangements for VA risk take many forms some

cover the guarantee rider only and others may include the base contract.

Fitch typically gives 100% credit in Prism for third-party reinsurance arrangements,

subject to a charge for counterparty risk. However, Fitch does not give any credit for

affiliated reinsurance arrangements based on the view that the risk has not left the

organization but rather has simply been moved from one entity to another.

#### Hedging

Virtually all of the established VA players rely on some type of hedging program to

manage economic risk, earning volatility, and/or capital requirements. These hedging

programs range from simple static delta hedges to more sophisticated (and complex)

“3-Greek” dynamic hedges that involve daily reviews and rebalancing of hedge

positions. The former tends to be used more to provide extreme downside surplus

protection, while the latter tends to be used by life insurers that want to manage

earnings volatility.

There are advantages and disadvantages to the various hedge programs used by life

insurers. The static hedge programs are easier to implement and maintain but they

don’t address second-order risks (e.g., interest rate risk, volatility risk). Dynamic

hedging programs do a better job of managing second-order risks but they are difficult

to implement, expensive to maintain and they are subject to significant operational risk.

The primary challenge confronting all types of hedge programs is the sensitivity to tail

risk, the long-dated nature of the VA liability and the use of assumptions that may

prove to be inaccurate (e.g., policyholder behavior).

⎯ However, hedging is not a panacea. It is a permanent and expensive program not a

⎯ one-time ad hoc activity requiring continuous updates, improvements and a

knowledgeable staff. Over-hedging can substantially decrease the upside potential of

the product, in that an insurer can hedge away its profits along with limiting capital

requirements. Even the most sophisticated programs cannot perfectly hedge VA risks as

insurers are always exposed to some degree of:

• Basis risk: Insurers use regression studies to fit the performance of their sub-

accounts to common equity indices. The correlation coefficient (R2) tends to

exceed 90% (max is 100%) in aggregate but some funds can be below 50%.

• Policyholder behavior risk: There are no derivative instruments that can hedge

mortality or utilization risks (see more on policyholder behavior risk below).

### Insurance

<!-- Table 1: pos=(0.00,82.08,612.00,99.06) -->
• Volatility risks: Insurers can limit volatility exposure but cannot “lock in” a cost.

Some insurers have used variance swaps to offset their short volatility positions.

• Mismatch risk: Hedge products tend to have maturities of one to five years while VA

20−30 guarantees can last years. Insurers need to carefully ladder their hedge

maturities so they do not expire at one time and also spread their hedges amongst a

number of counterparties to ensure competitive pricing and reduce counterparty

credit risk.

Fitch limits the amount of hedge credit due to the risks outlined above and concerns

over the untested nature of these hedging programs. Hedge credit given to VA writers

with established hedging programs that have been operational for more than two years

40%−70% tends to be in the range.

## What are the “Greeks”?

The more sophisticated strategies hedge Delta, Vega and Rho through the use of put

and call options, index futures and interest rate futures and swaps. Other strategies

may employ a core, static hedge consisting of long-dated derivatives with a dynamic

Delta hedge to adjust the positions for new sales or policyholder behavior.

### Delta: A measure of how much an option price changes given a unit change in the

underlying stock / future price.

### Gamma: A measure of how fast Delta changes given a unit change in the underlying

stock price.

### Rho: A measure of how much an option price changes for a 1% change in interest

rates.

### Vega: A measure of the rate of change in the value of an option for a 1% increase in

volatility of the underlying asset.

### Theta: A measure of the rate of change of an options value with respect to the

passage of time.
